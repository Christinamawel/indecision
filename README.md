# _Indecision_  

#### By **Christina Welch**

#### _This project is a work in progress. It will be my final capstone project for Epicodus School._

## Capstone Project Proposal

### Name of Project: indecision -an android phone app

### Project's Purpose or Goal: a phone app to help users make decisions in fun ways.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
-the user can input options and use the app to randomly output one option to them.

 ### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
-Android Studio with Kotlin

 ### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
-I would like to add various fun ways to get an answer like a spinning wheel, rolling dice, or maybe even a small game. It would be great if I have time to add different styles of randomization a user can choose from.

-I would like to learn how to publish my app onto the google play store as a real application.

-I would love if I have time to allow users to save past questions and possible outcomes so they can use them again. for example if the user makes a wheel of possible dinners to eat that night it would be great if they could come back to the same wheel again.

-I would also like if the user can modify their decisions and options, and add a button to remove whichever option was chosen so they can re roll again right away without that option

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
-I think I would need to learn firebase with kotlin or some other database tool

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
-I made the MVP of this simple because I'm not sure how far I can get in learning Kotlin. If I am able to learn enough I would like to add a lot more and really make this a full fledged App
